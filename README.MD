SnakesandLadders

It is the table game with the snakes and the ladders we played
as children.
The game is played with 2-5 players. There are as you will 
see "Go to" squares represents the snakes and the ladders.
There is also a "moveX2" square which gives the player the 
ability to play the result of the dice multiplied by 2.
